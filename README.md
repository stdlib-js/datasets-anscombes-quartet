    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Anscombe's Quartet

<section class="intro">

[Anscombe's quartet][anscombes-quartet] is a set of `4` datasets which all have nearly identical simple statistical properties but vary considerably when graphed. [Anscombe][francis-anscombe] created the datasets to demonstrate why graphical data exploration should **precede** statistical data analysis and to show the effect of outliers on statistical properties.

## Usage

```javascript
import data from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/datasets-anscombes-quartet@v0.2.1-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### data()

Returns [Anscombe's quartet][anscombes-quartet], which is comprised of `4` individual datasets, where each individual dataset is an `array` of `[x,y]` tuples.

```javascript
var d = data();
/* returns
